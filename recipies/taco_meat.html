    <h1>Taco Meat Recipe</h1>
    <p>This recipe makes just the taco meat. You have to buy everything else, of course. Make a big batch and use for a multiple of different meals: add 
        to bean burritos for a more hearty and tasty burrito, or add a can of beans (kidney, red, or pinto) and use for Frito® Pie, Navajo tacos, or taco 
        salad.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce, or more to taste</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    
    <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    
    <p>Season beef with onion powder, garlic salt, celery salt, and cumin. Pour tomato sauce over the beef, stir to coat, and simmer until thickened,
       slightly, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>I sometimes use a 15-ounce can of tomato sauce to make it stretch further.</p>
